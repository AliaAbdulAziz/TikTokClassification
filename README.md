TikTok is a social media platform for creating, sharing and discovering short videos. The app is used as an outlet for people to express themselves and allows users to create videos and share them across a community. TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims.

**Problem:** These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by a limited number of moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner.

**Proposed Solution:** To create a predictive machine learning model that classifies videos as either claims or opinions.

These are the steps taken to create the model:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Hypothesis Testing
3. Regression Modelling
4. Classifying videos using machine learning
